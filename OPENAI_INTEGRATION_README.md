# OpenAI Integration for Sustainability Chatbot

Your chatbot and ESG analyzer have been successfully updated to use OpenAI instead of Groq!

## What's Changed

### 1. **ChatBot Component** (`src/components/sustainability/ChatBot.tsx`)
- Now uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for more accurate responses
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better conversation context management

### 2. **ESG Analyzer** (`src/components/sustainability/ESGAnalyzer.tsx`)
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for more detailed ESG analysis
- Enhanced report analysis capabilities
- More comprehensive scoring and recommendations

### 3. **New OpenAI Service** (`src/services/openaiService.ts`)
- Centralized OpenAI API management
- Proper error handling for API quotas and rate limits
- Reusable service for both chatbot and ESG analysis

## Configuration

Your `.env` file is already configured with:
